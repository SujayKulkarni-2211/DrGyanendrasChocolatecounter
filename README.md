Dr. Gyanendra's Chocolate Counter Application
Purpose
Dr. Gyanendra Tiwari, a Data Structures and Algorithms professor, has a unique policy of awarding chocolates to students who successfully answer his special questions, known as "chocolate questions". The goal of the Chocolate Counter application is to digitize and streamline the process of tracking which students have answered these questions and how many chocolates each student has accumulated. This application replaces the traditional notebook and digital notes method, offering a more efficient and automated way to manage this rewarding system.

Key Features
Database Initialization:

Initializes an SQLite database (chocolate_counter.db) and sets up the leaderboard table to store student names and their corresponding chocolate counts.
Search and Add:

Allows the user to search for a student's name. If the student is found in the database, their chocolate count is updated. If the student is not found, a new entry is created for the student with the specified number of chocolates.
Add Chocolates:
